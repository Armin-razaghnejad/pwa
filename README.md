# CvApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.

## Run As PWA App

Connect your mobile device and development machine to the same local network (e.g., Wi-Fi).

Find the local IP address of your development machine.

Start your Angular development server by running `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0` to listen on all available network interfaces.

On your mobile device, open a web browser and enter the IP address followed by the port number (e.g., http://192.168.0.10:4200) to access your Angular app.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
